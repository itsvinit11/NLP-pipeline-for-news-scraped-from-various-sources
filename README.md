# NLP-pipeline-for-news-scraped-from-various-sources
Steps involved in creating an NLP pipeline for news summarization. Here's some more information on the implementation details of these steps:

Data Preprocessing:

•	To load the dataset of news articles, you can use the pandas' library to read a CSV or Excel file into a DataFrame.

•	To remove HTML tags, punctuation, and special characters from the text, you can use regular expressions or the BeautifulSoup library in Python.

•	To tokenize the sentences in the news articles, you can use NLTK or spaCy libraries.

Text Cleaning:

•	To eliminate stopwords from the news articles, you can use NLTK or spaCy libraries to get a list of stopwords and remove them from the text.

•	To remove any sentences that contain no meaningful information, you can use regular expressions to identify sentences that contain only dates or numbers and remove them from the text.

Sentence Scoring:

•	To calculate the TF-IDF scores of each sentence, you can use TfidfVectorizer from the sklearn library.

•	To rank the sentences based on their scores, you can use the NumPy library in Python to sort the sentences based on their scores.

•	To select the top N sentences with the highest scores, you can simply slice the sorted array of sentences.

Model Evaluation:

•	To divide the dataset into a training set and a test set, you can use the train_test_split function from sklearn.

•	To train the model on the training set, you can fit the TfidfVectorizer to the training set and calculate the TF-IDF scores for each sentence in the training set.

•	To test the model's performance on the test set, you can calculate the TF-IDF scores for each sentence in the test set and compare the generated summary to the actual summary.


This code performs text summarization using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm.
The necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the code:

•	pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.

•	re (regular expression) is used for pattern matching and string manipulation.

•	nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) is a platform used for natural language processing, which includes tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.

•	stopwords is a list of common words in a language that do not carry any significant meaning in a sentence.

•	TfidfVectorizer is a class from sklearn used for converting a collection of text documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features.


The dataset of news articles is loaded into a pandas DataFrame object called 'news_df' from the 'news.csv' file.
The 'preprocess_text' function is defined to perform text preprocessing tasks such as removing HTML tags, removing punctuation and special characters, converting text to lowercase, and removing stopwords.
The 'clean_text' column is added to the 'news_df' DataFrame by applying the 'preprocess_text' function to the 'content' column.
The 'sentences' list is created by tokenizing the sentences in the 'clean_text' column using NLTK's 'sent_tokenize' function.
The 'filtered_sentences' list is created by removing stopwords from the 'sentences' list using NLTK's 'stopwords' list.
The 'clean_sentences' list is created by removing sentences that contain no meaningful information such as sentences containing only dates or numbers.
The TF-IDF scores of each sentence in the 'clean_sentences' list are calculated using the TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.
The sentences are ranked based on their TF-IDF scores in descending order.
The top N sentences with the highest scores are selected to create a summary of the news article, where N is set to 5 in this code.
The top N sentences are printed to the console using the 'join' function to join the sentences with a newline character.
